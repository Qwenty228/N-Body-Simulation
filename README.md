# N-Body-Simulation
The N-Body Simulation project models gravitational interactions among celestial bodies using Numba for high-performance computation. Based on Dr. Yves Hilpisch's implementation, it offers an efficient, easy-to-use simulation for educational and research purposes, with visualization using Matplotlib.
